<h1>Best Movies according to Kelvin</h1>
<h2>3 movies I've seen that I would put in my top movies list.</h2>

<h3>"A Silent Voice"</h3>
<p>This is one of my favorite anime movies of all time. It was an emotional roalercoaster in all sense of the phrase. Its various visual elements to represent character emotions combined with beautiful art and animation style made this a comeback movie for me. It is a sad movie, and a happy movie, and a movie with real life situations that will tug at anyone emotionally. I super recommend this if youre looking for a non shonen, anime movie to watch.</p>
    

<h3>"Back to the Future 3</h3>
<p>The reason I love this Back to the Future movie specifically is because it takes place in the Wild West, and I am a huge nerd for old western fiction and non fiction. The premise of the movie itself is fantastic, involving wild west action and time travel and the little callbacks to the other movies that were made.</p>
     
<h3>The Marvelous Seven</h3>
<p> Honestly, this is another callback to how I love Western Movies, even if there are entirely fiction. Of course, I'd be remised if I didn't mention some of the amazing movies I have seen, like "Django" but this is a movie I saw recently and I enjoyed it. It involved a small gang of gunslingers and fighters from all over who would protect a small town of people that were being used up for protection money by a local gang. Very basic premise, but definitely worth the watch should you stumble upon it.</p>
